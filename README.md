# GhostGrid AI Ecosystem

**GhostGrid** is a modular, multi-agent AI-driven cybersecurity and automation framework designed to operate as the neural and operational core of next-gen MSP, offensive/defensive security, and AI-integrated infrastructure environments.

---

## Overview

GhostGrid integrates 14+ modular AI agents with a unified orchestration core (**JARVIS**) to enable:
- Autonomous task execution via voice, API, or CLI
- Full-stack system visibility and simulation
- Zero Trust networking with intent-based enforcement
- Security automation across Blue, Red, and Ops domains
- Self-documenting compliance and reporting

Each module is independently deployable and communicates via a message bus with authentication, audit, and policy verification.
